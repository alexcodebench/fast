# About this App

* This is a quick and small demo app build with FastAPI + Angular + [Ng-zorro](https://ng.ant.design/docs/introduce/en) library

* The app lists multiple clubs and their members within a nested table. Rows can be ordered by clicking any header. Inline edit is supported

* Scenarios and persistent solution have been simplified

* The app was deployed within docker containers:
  - Frontend (Angular) — Nginx
  - Backend (FastAPI + Uvicorn) — Python 3.9
  - Reverse Proxy — Nginx

* Local development can be set up in two ways: using docker or on local host directly
