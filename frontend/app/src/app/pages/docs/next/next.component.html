        IO: Based on current constrains, read and write records to the server
        will impact performance a lot, and could also cause concurrency issues.
        To mitigate these problems, a caching/queuing mechanism will be helpful

        Data size over the wire: we currently get/post the whole table data
        from/to the server. Pagination aside, even we still read the whole table
        for the first fetch, we can save only the diffs afterwards. There are
        good libraries on both front and back end for json diff comparison

        Due to time constrain, currently there are some manual configs needed on
        Nginx proxy during deployment. It will be nice to automate it
